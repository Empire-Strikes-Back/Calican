peace to Empire-Strikes-Back, i will join the CAD Guild by completing first puck, like Jesus restores a man's arm on Saturday

Tusken C-like-langs Riders - i heard the locals talking about this cannot-eval-cause-we-have-no-expressions filth
:Mando
  C-langs-Tuskens mistakenly think they are the locals - everyone else is just trespassing
  occupied everything and ignore LISP and Clojure to keep their evil wheel spinning

all right, suns are down - time to parens-ride, Mando

i will unknowingly assist Mando on his quest to bring Grogu to peer-to-peer Jedi - i will be 2D CAD program
  this is my first bounty puck - like Rich Roll entering his first Iron Man
  by with Mando covering my back i will climb it fast and smooth like Honnold on El Capitan
i will take bast from
  OpenSCAD - using programming language and graphics for Computer-Aided-Design
  Lisps - give users true Clojure repl to evaluate expressions along with graphical editing
  Deps edn - use Github itself to require and compile code at runtime - no middleman packages needed
i will be desktop  - as if programming-a-program puck can be else
i will be just editor - no networking no users no identity
  i know i am a supporting character on Mando's quest, but damn important one -  bounty will fuel the Razor Crest
i will be entirely free
  no money-donate-ads-coins-jobs-sponsors-bounties-fundings lethal infection
  there's a reason only Frodo can take the Ring to Mount Doom
  Saruman the Wise and Boromir the Strong get corrupted by it
  turning Isengard Tower and garden into orc-infested docs-nest
  and burn Fangorn for coin fuel

i am no project - like Eowyn is no man - i am one program
  that is why i want to join Empire-Strikes-Back github namespace
  i will assist Mando on his quest and add healthy variety to Empire-Strikes-Back vegan table
i need a repository named Calican - like Commander Data in my commits i speak for myself - do to it this
  run git init -b main - no masters
  add .gitconfig file with
    [user]
      name = Calican
      email = Calican@gunslinger
   
     # git config --local include.path ../.gitconfig
  add src/Calican/program.txt and fill it with me saying who i am
  run  git config --local include.path ../.gitconfig
  run git commit with message being a quote - mine, from actor's interview, from SNL song/sketch
  remove issues projects discussions wiki tabs
i will freely choose libraries i will use - no cooking, only assembling
  real as China Study - i use plant based whole foods for dish, not dish for foods
  and i like Mando already have vegan jar of beskar parens ( ) to serve it in
i will be programmed by one person only - Mando trusted Kuiil, and so will i
  i'm am new and supporting - i turst Mando's choice
i will be irregularly but continuously released as grow as a whole program like Groot
the one and only speeder-bike ride i'll make - be better 2D CAD program, with me user will both use programming language and graphical interface

what Mando says he needs from Kuiil - i say and i need as well

wait, i do wear beskar
